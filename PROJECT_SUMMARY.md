## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start all services
./scripts/start-all.sh

# Check system health
./scripts/health-check.sh

# Run tests
JWT_SECRET=dev-secret-key-for-testing-only-256bits-long npm run test:integration

# Stop all services
./scripts/stop-all.sh
```

## 📊 System Status

### Current Running Services
- **API Server**: Port 10001 ✅
- **Frontend**: Port 10002-10004 ✅
- **Database**: 54 tables ✅
- **WebSocket**: Active ✅

### Recent Improvements
1. Fixed trading history `tableName` initialization error
2. Enhanced blockchain monitoring with dynamic address management
3. Implemented operation type detection for transactions
4. Added comprehensive fallback price handling strategy
5. Created complete test documentation with CI/CD integration
6. **CRITICAL FIX**: Blockchain monitoring now correctly returns only actually added addresses (not input array)
7. **ENHANCEMENT**: Added transparency for skipped/duplicate addresses in monitoring responses

## 🔧 Configuration

### Key Environment Variables
```env
JWT_SECRET=dev-secret-key-for-testing-only-256bits-long
PORT=10001
DATABASE_URL=./data/bot.db
BSC_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
COINGECKO_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### Fallback Price Strategy
- **Block**: Prevents trading with fallback prices
- **Warn**: Allows with warning
- **Confirm**: Requires user confirmation
- **Allow**: Permits trading (dev only)

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **API Response Time**: < 100ms
- **Database Tables**: 54
- **Test Coverage**: 20/20 integration tests passing
- **Concurrent Request Handling**: ✅
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized with limits

## 🛡️ Security Measures

- JWT authentication with 256-bit secrets
- Encrypted wallet storage
- Rate limiting (100 req/min general, 10 req/min trading)
- Input validation on all endpoints
- CORS configuration
- Security headers enabled
